                    I have been interested in computers since my youth. I created my first website back then.
                    During my vocational training, I learned to program CNC machines and robots. I have always seen
                    these things as a hobby or a nice thing to do at work. Since I am not satisfied with my current
                    situation, I looked at what was always important to me and what gave me joy. And that was to combine
                    computer work and problem solving. My journey to becoming a web developer began shortly after. I
                    started my IT journey by coding small exercises at home to get professional training and build
                    projects. I am excited about building on my experience and starting my career in IT in a junior
                    developer position.
