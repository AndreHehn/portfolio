                    I have been interested in computers since my youth. I created my first website back then.
                    During my vocational training, I learned to program CNC machines and robots. I have always seen
                    these things as a hobby or a nice thing to do at work.
                    As I learned to love the programming part and I enjoyed it even more than working with the machine
                    hardware, I decided to amplify my software skills. Programming gives me joy as I love to combine
                    computer work and problem solving. Thus, I decided to gain practical experience and build real
                    projects while learning web development in a professional environment.
                    My journey to becoming a web developer began shortly after. I
                    started my IT journey by coding small exercises at home to get professional training and build
                    projects. I am excited about building on my experience and starting my career in IT in a junior
                    developer position.
