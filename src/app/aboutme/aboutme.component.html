                    Since my youth, I've been interested in computers. During my first vocational training, I learned
                    how to program CNC machines. I've always seen these things as a hobby or a kind of benefit while at
                    work. After discovering all these things about myself, I decided to combine working on a computer
                    with solving problems. My journey to becoming a web developer began shortly after.
